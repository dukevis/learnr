#RQGIS package

This tutorial uses QGIS 2.14.6 Essen and R 3.3.1 and is intended to introduce the usage of QGIS tools in R.  

Note: this tutorial only introduces the methodology of setting up the script and running QGIS tools since there are hundreds of tools in QGIS.  This tutorial focuses more on raster data because advanced tools cannot be run with QGIS tools.
